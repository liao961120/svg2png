# svg2png

This is a small web app (with no server) that converts SVG images to PNG images. In other words, there is **no file upload limit**, since all the computation is done locally using JavaScript and the web browser.

## Usage

Simply visit <https://liao961120.github.io/svg2png> and the rest should be clear.

Note that to change the resolution of the output PNGs, you can set **DPI** (defaults to 96) after uploading the SVGs.
